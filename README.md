# About Me ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello there! My name is Gordon. I'm a recent graduate from James Madison University where I majored in Finance and minored in Data Analytics and Mathematics. I started my college thinking I wanted a career in Finance, but as time went on I become more and more interested in data analytics due to its complexity and array of skills required for the field. I picked up a minor in both Mathematics and Data Analytics to expand my skill set needed to become a data professional. This offered the perfect opportunity to balance my coursework between business acumen, programming and machine learning skills, and mathematics knowledge. I'm currently a Data Analyst at Fisher Invedtments using SQL, R and Power BI in my daily work.
