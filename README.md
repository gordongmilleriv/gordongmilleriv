# About Me ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello there! My name is Gordon. I'm a recent graduate from James Madison University where I majored in Finance and minored in Data Analytics and Mathematics. I started my college journey majoring in Finance, but as time went on I become more and more interested in data science due to its complexity and array of skills required for the field. To expand my palette of skills I picked up a second major in mathematics. However, fortunately during my Junior year my university introduced a new minor in Data Analytics that included coursework in programming, data visualizations and machine learning. I wanted my coursework to best reflect the skills needed to be a data scientist, so I decided to split my math major into a minor in mathematics and a minor in data analytics. I'm currently pursuing a career in data science and am intersted in sharing my personal projects and contributing to data science and machine learning open source projects.
