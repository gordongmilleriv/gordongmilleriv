# About Me ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello there! My name is Gordon. I'm a recent graduate from James Madison University where I majored in Finance and minored in Data Analytics and Mathematics. I started my college thinking I wanted a career in Finance, but as time went on I become more and more interested in data science due to its complexity and array of skills required for the field. I picked up a second major in mathematics to expand my palette of skills, however, during my Junior year at JMU, a new minor in Data Analytics that included coursework in programming, data visualizations and machine learning was introduced. This offered the perfect opportunity to balance my coursework between business acumen, programming and mahcine learning skills, and mathematics knowledge, all the skills needed to be a data scientist. I'm currently pursuing a career in data science and am intersted in sharing my personal projects and contributing to data science and machine learning open source projects.
